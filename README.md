# FeeFlow
Kiln hackathon project submission


## Description
Fee Flow is a innovative solution that combines DeFi and Traditionnal Commerce.
We want to bridge the gap between these two worlds and simplify DeFi for the retail.
This will allow anyone to buy a product without spending their money, instead they will utilize DeFi solutions to generate some cashflow that will repay the loan over time.
